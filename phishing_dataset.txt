Hi Kingcooler321,You’re receiving this message because you have not used Google Photos in nearly two years and if you do not sign in to your account, your Face Groups content will be deleted.
Face Groups helps you automatically organize your photos by grouping similar faces together, so you can find people and pets faster, and see memories and creations that feature your loved ones. By default, your face groups are only visible to you.
If you want to keep your Face Groups content, please sign in to Google Photos using the link below or go to photos.google.com/reactivate and log in using the account associated with your email address.
If you take no action, Face Groups will be turned off after May 19, 2024. This will also delete all of your face groups, the face models used to create them, and any face labels you've created.
To learn more, visit our Help Center.
Thank you,
Your Google Photos Team		No

Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.Best would be to have a button for "Global sort and update all scan caches"
in the exmh More... menu--
